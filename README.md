##Usage
```Lua
local Camera = require 'Path.to.camera'

function love.load()
	Cam = Camera.new( 64, 64, 800 - 64 * 2, 600 - 64 * 2 )
	-- This creates a camera that appears on the screen's x and y of 64, 64 and is 800 - 64 * 2 width, and etc.
	Cam:setPosition( 400, 300 ) -- This sets the camera's center at 400, 600.
end

local function drawWorld()
	love.graphics.rectangle( 'fill', 32, 32, 32, 32 )
end

function love.load()
	Cam:push()
		drawWorld()
	Cam:pop()
end
```
And that's it! 

##Name
- Brady is named after Matthew Brady, famous American Civil War photographer. I thought it would be fitting if the camera library would be named after a famous person who used a camera.

##Functions
###Camera.new
- Creates a new camera object.
- Synopsis:
	- `Cam = Camera.new( screenX, screenY, width, height )`
	- `Cam = Camera( screenX, screenY, width, height )`
- Arguments: 
	- `screenX`, `screenY`: Numbers. The x and y coordinates for where the camera will be on the screen.
	- `width`, `height`: Numbers. The width and height of the camera at the scale of 1, as well as the size it occupies on the screen.
- Returns: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object.
- Notes: 
	- By default, the camera has one layer: main. This layer is automatically drawn and done by default and acts just like any other layer.

###Camera:push
- Push the graphics to prepare for the camera.
- Synopses:
	- `Camera.push( Cam )`
	- `Cam:push()`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
- Returns: 
	- Nothing.

###Camera:pop
- Pops the graphics to close-out the camera.
- Synopses: 
	- `Camera.pop( Cam )`
	- `Cam:pop()`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
- Returns
	- Nothing.

###Camera:draw
- Adds manual z-ordering so you don't have to worry about it.
- Synopses:
	- `Camera.draw( Cam )`
	- `Cam:draw()`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
- Returns: 
	- Nothing.

###Camera:setWorld
- Set world boundaries (AABB) required for certain functions.
- Synopses:
	- `World = Camera.setWorld( Cam, x, y, width, height )`
	- `World = Cam:setWorld( x, y, width, height )`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
	- `x`, `y`: Numbers. The top left x and y coordinates for the world.
	- `width`, `height`: Numbers. The width and height of the world. 
- Returns: 
	- `World`: Table. A table with the world's information (`{ x = x, y, = y, width = width, height = height }`)

###World Functions
- These functions require a world to be set using [Camera:setWorld](#camerasetworld).

#####Camera:adjustScale
- Put this inside of love.update in order to keep the camera scaled within the world coordinates. This does __not__ acount for position, for that see [Camera:adjustPosition](#cameraadjustposition).
- Synopses:
	- `Camera.adjustScale( Cam )`
	- `Cam:adjustScale()`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
- Returns: 
	- Nothing.

#####Camera:adjustPosition
- Put this inside of love.update in order to keep the camera positioned within the world (i.e. you can't see outside of the world boundaries). This does __not__ account for scaling (and frankly, doesn't really work without bound-scaling), for that, see [Camera:adjustScale](#cameraadjustscale).
- Synopses:
	- `Camera.adjustPosition( Cam )`
	- `Cam:adjustPosition()`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
- Returns: 
	- Nothing.

###Camera:addLayer
- Adds a layer to the camera. Layers are used for parallax scrolling.
- Synopses: 
	- `Layer = Camera.addLayer( Cam, name, scale )`
	- `Layer = Cam:addLayer( name, scale )`
- Arguments: 
	- `Cam`: Table. A camera object returned by [Camera.new](#cameranew).
	- `name`: String. The name the camera will be referred to by.
	- `scale`: Number. The amount by which you increase/decrease the scale.
- Returns: 
	- Layer`: Table. The layer information that is drawn.
```Lua
layer = Cam:addLayer( 'testLayer', .5 )

-- Drawing
layer:push()
	...
layer:pop()
```
